        Raised in the east side of Chicago I, Jose Lopez, am a fullstack web
        developer, poker player, and soccer enthusiast. While I was studying
        sociology at Prairie State College, I began to teach myself how to code
        basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after a friend approached me to design a
        website for his clothing line. During the process, I found my love and
        passion for coding as to me a webpage resembles a blank canvas. This
        blank canvas allows me to both help others & express myself creatively.
        My web apps convey my love and admiration of minimalist fashion,
        architecture, and design philosophy.
