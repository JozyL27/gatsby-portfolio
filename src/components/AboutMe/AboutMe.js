        Raised in the east & south sides of Chicago I, Jose Lopez, am a
        fullstack web developer, poker player, soccer enthusiast, and designer
        reseller. After studying sociology at Prairie State College, I began to
        teach myself how to code basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript after a friend
        approached me to design a website for a clothing line. During the
        process, I found my love and passion for coding as to me a webpage
        resembled a blank canvas. This blank canvas allowed me to both help
        others & express myself creatively. My websites convey my love and
        admiration of minimalist fashion, architecture, and design philosophy.
